# Changelog

All notable changes to Codico will be documented in this file.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-10-05

### Fixed
- Chat panel was unresponsive in 0.1.0: a syntax error in the webview script left every button, input and message handler unwired.

### Added
- Regression test that parses every webview script (`chat.html` inline scripts and `media/*.js`), so a webview syntax error fails CI.
- Marketplace `AI` / `Chat` categories and search keywords.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-10-05

### Added
- Provider-native tool/function calling for OpenRouter and supported direct providers, with fenced tools retained as a compatibility fallback.
- Provider-native tool-call/result history round-tripping across iterations for OpenAI/OpenRouter, Anthropic, and Gemini.
- Automatic fallback to fenced compatibility mode when OpenRouter or a direct provider rejects native tools.
- DNS-resolved and DNS-pinned `fetch_url` protection against private-address redirects and DNS rebinding.
- Browser public-network enforcement for navigation, redirects, and subresources, with explicit `codico.browserAllowPrivateNetwork` opt-in for localhost/internal apps.
- Minimal MCP child-process environment inheritance.
- Fault/integration coverage for real SSE disconnects, native tool fragments, provider serializers, browser/DNS policy, MCP environment policy, and terminal timeout/abort behavior.
- Real VS Code Extension Host activation smoke test.
- VSIX install/list smoke test in CI and release workflows.
- VSIX packaging on pull requests plus tag/manual release automation for GitHub Releases, Visual Studio Marketplace, and Open VSX.

### Changed
- Secure URL fetching, terminal process lifecycle, MCP environment policy, provider conversation serialization, workspace diagnostics, agent history mutation, Markdown rendering, and stream notice rendering are split out of the main provider/webview monoliths.
- Codico package version moves from prototype `0.0.1` to release candidate `0.1.0`.
